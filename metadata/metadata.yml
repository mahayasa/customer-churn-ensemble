name: Application of machine learning for predicting ultimate joint shear capacity and failure modes of beam-column joints (Python Implementation)
description: This capsule contains code for the paper "Structural health monitoring of exterior beam-column subassemblies through detailed numerical modelling and using various machine learning techniques". Structural health monitoring of beam-column joints is paramount, as they are critical load-carrying components of reinforced concrete buildings. Evaluating the ultimate joint shear capacity and failure modes of beam-columns, especially in seismic events, is a crucial task, especially in view of life safety concerns. A few machine learning and deep learning algorithms were selected for predicting the joint shear capacity and mode of failure of beam-column joints are shared in this capsule. The models except for ANN, PSO-ANN, and XGBoost were constructed using the widely used python library (Pedregosa et al. 2011) scikit learn 0.23.1. The library is also equipped with a class (GridSearchCV) to optimize the hyperparameters for various models through brute force which builds several models based on the range of values provided for various parameters.
