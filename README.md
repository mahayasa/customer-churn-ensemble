# Customer Churn Prediction Using Weight Average Ensemble Machine Learning Model
 The main purpose of this study is to build a framework with several combinations of preprocessing techniques and an ensemble of two machine learning models, XGBoost and random forest. The dataset for this study is from a public dataset platform; the experiment uses two different sectors: telecom and insurance
 
## ML Framework

Two differents dataset preprocessed by filling missing value and SMOTE. After the preprocessing finished, ensemble machine learning did a classification task for churn prediction

## The Result
- Telecom dataset : F1-Score (0.850)
- Insurance dataset : F1-Score (0.947)
